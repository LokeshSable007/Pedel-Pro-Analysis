# Pedel Pro Bike Company Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Pedel Pro bike company using a comprehensive dataset of 9 tables. The analysis involves leveraging SQL to solve key business questions and derive valuable insights. Advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and window functions were used to handle complex queries. The cleaned and processed data was then connected to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization.

Key objectives included identifying top-selling bike models, optimizing inventory management, analyzing customer purchasing patterns, assessing marketing campaign effectiveness, and evaluating staff efficiency and its impact on sales and customer satisfaction.
